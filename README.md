# SDG 2: Zero Hunger

“End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture.”

Your AgriSmart Yield Optimizer and Farmers Chatbot address SDG 2 by:

Predicting crop yield to reduce food insecurity.

Guiding farmers on efficient resource use to maximize output.

Providing season- and soil-specific advice for better planning.

 # Solution: A Technical Synopsis
Component	SDG Impact
Yield Prediction Model	Boosts productivity & reduces crop failure
Chatbot Integration	Democratizes access to farming guidance
Azure Deployment	Scales impact across regions
Resource Recommendations	Minimizes input waste (fertilizer, water, etc.)

# Farmers_Chatbot
🔗 Integration Blueprint
# 1. Define Use Cases
Integrate yield prediction into your chatbot for:

💬 “What's my expected crop yield?”

📌 “How much fertilizer should I use for loamy soil?”

🕒 “What’s the best season to grow soybeans?”

# 2. NLP Model Enhancements
Based on your skills in intent classification and entity extraction:

Intents:

predict_yield

recommend_resources

crop_guidance

Entities:

Crop_Type, Farm_Area, Soil_Type, Irrigation_Type, Season

Use libraries like spaCy or Rasa NLU, or build custom pipelines with scikit-learn.

# 3. Link ML Model to Chatbot
Import your trained model into the chatbot backend.

Create a prediction handler like:

python
def predict_yield(crop, area, soil, irrigation, season, fertilizer, pesticide, water):
    features = preprocess_input(crop, area, soil, irrigation, season, fertilizer, pesticide, water)
    return model.predict([features])[0]
Connect it to a response flow in the chatbot:

python
user_input = extract_entities(user_message)
response = predict_yield(**user_input)
bot_reply = f"Estimated yield is {response:.2f} tons for your setup!"
☁️ 4. Deploy the Unified System on Azure
Host chatbot with Azure Bot Service

Serve your model via Azure Functions or Flask API on Azure App Service

Use Azure Cosmos DB to track chat logs and feedback
