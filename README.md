# 🚧 Problem in SDG 2: Zero Hunger
Despite global efforts, hunger is rising again. Here are key challenges:

📉 **Low Agricultural Productivity** Many smallholder farmers lack access to modern tools, soil data, and crop planning support.

🌍 **Climate Shocks & Unpredictability** Droughts, floods, and shifting seasons disrupt planting cycles and reduce yields2.

📊 **Poor Access to Market Information** Farmers often sell crops at low prices due to lack of real-time market data.

🦠 **Pest & Disease Outbreaks** Limited early detection leads to crop loss and food insecurity4.

🗣️ **Language & Literacy Barriers** Many farmers struggle to access agricultural advice due to language or digital literacy gaps.
